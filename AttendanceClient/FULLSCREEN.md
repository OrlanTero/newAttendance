# Fullscreen Implementation for AttendanceClient

This document outlines the changes made to implement a robust fullscreen mode in the AttendanceClient application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Main Process (index.js)

- Set `fullscreen: true` in the BrowserWindow options to start the application in fullscreen mode
- Added event listeners for fullscreen state changes:
  - `enter-full-screen`
  - `leave-full-screen`
- Implemented automatic recovery to fullscreen mode if the user exits it
- Added IPC handlers for toggling and checking fullscreen state
- Modified the window creation process to utilize the full screen size

### 2. Preload Script (preload.js)

- Added new IPC channels for fullscreen functionality:
  - `toggle-fullscreen`
  - `check-fullscreen`
  - `window-state-change` (for receiving fullscreen state updates)
- Created a new `windowManager` API to expose fullscreen-related functionality to the renderer process

### 3. Main App Component (App.jsx)

- Added state management for tracking fullscreen status
- Implemented a notification system that alerts users when they exit fullscreen mode
- Added a button to easily return to fullscreen mode
- Set up keyboard shortcut handling for F11 key to toggle fullscreen
- Wrapped all routes in a consistent fullscreen-friendly container

### 4. Page Components

#### AttendanceScreen.jsx
- Updated styling to utilize the full viewport with `width: 100vw` and `height: 100vh`
- Adjusted padding, margin, and spacing to better fit fullscreen layout
- Improved form controls and typography for better visibility on large screens

#### SplashScreen.jsx
- Modified layout to center content properly in fullscreen mode
- Updated styling to maintain visual consistency in fullscreen display
- Enhanced the visual appearance with appropriate padding and spacing

#### ServerConfigPage.jsx
- Updated form controls to be more accessible in fullscreen mode
- Adjusted layout to maintain proper spacing and alignment
- Enhanced visual appearance with appropriate styling

### 5. Build and Launch Scripts

- Added new npm scripts in package.json:
  - `build-prod`: Builds the application in production mode
  - `start-prod`: Starts the application in production mode
  - `fullscreen`: Combines build and start commands for production mode
- Created platform-specific launch scripts:
  - `start-fullscreen.bat` for Windows
  - `start-fullscreen.sh` for macOS/Linux

### 6. Documentation

- Updated README.md with instructions for running in fullscreen mode
- Created FULLSCREEN.md (this document) to explain the implementation

## Testing Fullscreen Mode

To test the fullscreen implementation:

1. Run the application using `npm run fullscreen`
2. Verify that the application starts in fullscreen mode
3. Press F11 to exit fullscreen and confirm the notification appears
4. Click "Return to Fullscreen" to verify automatic recovery works
5. Test on different screen sizes to ensure responsive layout

## Benefits of Fullscreen Mode

- Maximizes screen real estate for attendance monitoring
- Improves visibility of attendance information
- Creates a more immersive and focused user experience
- Prevents accidental navigation away from the application
- Enhances security by minimizing desktop access during attendance tracking

## Future Improvements

- Add fullscreen toggle button in the application UI
- Implement kiosk mode option for even more restricted access
- Add option to customize fullscreen behavior in settings
- Implement different layouts optimized for various screen sizes
